# Intro to neuronal networks

This repository aims to store a set of exercises that represent an intro to neuronal networks. The labs and the homeworks 
are provided by the "University of Alexandru Ioan Cuza" from Iasi, Romania, within "Neuronal networks" course.

## Lab 1
#### _Python exercises_
1) Check if a number is prime
2) Sort alphabetically the words from `text.txt`
3) Matrix multiplication
   `matrix = [[11,2,3,4],
   [11,12,13,14],
   [21,22,23,24]]`
   
   `array = [2,-5,7,10]`

#### _Numpy exercises_
1) Create the above matrix and array in numpy
    - Display the last 2 columns of the first 2 rows
    - Display the last 2 elements of the array
2) Create 2 arrays having random values. 
The length of the arrays must be the same
    - Display which array has the sum of the elements greater
    - Sum up the arrays. Then, compute the multiplication of the arrays (vectorial and scalar)
3) Print the transpose of a matrix
